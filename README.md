# CyberPlayground

This project is a web-based playground designed to simulate and demonstrate various common web application security vulnerabilities. It provides an interactive environment where users can explore real-world security issues such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The goal is to raise awareness and understanding of these vulnerabilities by allowing users to test and learn the importance of secure coding practices.
